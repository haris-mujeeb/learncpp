However, the actual size of these types can vary based on the compiler and architecture.<\/p>\n<p>This variability was allowed so that the <code>int<\/code> and <code>double<\/code> data types could be set to the size that maximizes performance on a given architecture.  For example, a 32-bit computer will typically be able to process 32-bits of data at a time.  In such cases, an <code>int<\/code> would likely be set to a width of 32-bits, since this is the &#8220;natural&#8221; size of the data that the CPU operates on (and likely to be the most performant).<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">A reminder<\/p>\n<p>The number of bits a data type uses is called its width.  A wider data type is one that uses more bits, and a narrower data type is one that uses less bits.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p>But what happens when we want our 32-bit CPU to modify an 8-bit value (such as a <code>char<\/code>) or a 16-bit value?  Some 32-bit processors (such as 32-bit x86 CPUs) can manipulate 8-bit or 16-bit values directly.  However, doing so is often slower than manipulating 32-bit values!  Other 32-bit CPUs (like 32-bit PowerPC CPUs), can only operate on 32-bit values, and additional tricks must be employed to manipulate narrower values.<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Numeric promotion<\/p>\n<p>Because C++ is designed to be portable and performant across a wide range of architectures, the language designers did not want to assume a given CPU would be able to efficiently manipulate values that were narrower than the natural data size for that CPU.<\/p>\n<p>To help address this challenge, C++ defines a category of type conversions informally called the <code>numeric promotions<\/code>.  A <strong>numeric promotion<\/strong> is the type conversion of certain narrower numeric types (such as a <code>char<\/code>) to certain wider numeric types (typically <code>int<\/code> or <code>double<\/code>) that can be processed efficiently.<\/p>\n<p>All numeric promotions are value-preserving.  A <strong>value-preserving conversion<\/strong> (also called a <strong>safe conversion<\/strong>) is one where every possible source value can be converted into an equal value of the destination type.<\/p>\n<p>Because promotions are safe, the compiler will freely use numeric promotion as needed, and will not issue a warning when doing so.<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Numeric promotion reduces redundancy<\/p>\n<p>Numeric promotion solves another problem as well.  Consider the case where you wanted to write a function to print a value of type <code>int<\/code>:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\nvoid printInt(int x)\r\n{\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; '\\n';\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>While this is straightforward, what happens if we want to also be able to print a value of type <code>short<\/code>, or type <code>char<\/code>?  If type conversions did not exist, we&#8217;d have to write a different print function for <code>short<\/code> and another one for <code>char<\/code>.  And don&#8217;t forget another version for <code>unsigned char<\/code>, <code>signed char<\/code>, <code>unsigned short<\/code>, <code>wchar_t<\/code>, <code>char8_t<\/code>, <code>char16_t<\/code>, and <code>char32_t<\/code>!  You can see how this quickly becomes unmanageable.<\/p>\n<p>Numeric promotion comes to the rescue here: we can write functions that have <code>int<\/code> and\/or <code>double<\/code> parameters (such as the <code>printInt()<\/code> function above).  That same code can then be called with arguments of types that can be numerically promoted to match the types of the function parameters.<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Numeric promotion categories<\/p>\n<p>The numeric promotion rules are divided into two subcategories: <code>integral promotions<\/code> and <code>floating point promotions<\/code>.  Only the conversions listed in these categories are considered to be numeric promotions.<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Floating point promotions<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll start with the easier one.<\/p>\n<p>Using the <strong>floating point promotion<\/strong> rules, a value of type <code>float<\/code> can be converted to a value of type <code>double<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>This means we can write a function that takes a <code>double<\/code> and then call it with either a <code>double<\/code> or a <code>float<\/code> value:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\nvoid printDouble(double d)\r\n{\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; d &lt;&lt; '\\n';\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    printDouble(5.0); \/\/ no conversion necessary\r\n    printDouble(4.0f); \/\/ numeric promotion of float to double\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>In the second call to <code>printDouble()<\/code>, the <code>float<\/code> literal <code>4.0f<\/code> is promoted into a <code>double<\/code>, so that the type of argument matches the type of the function parameter.<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Integral promotions<\/p>\n<p>The integral promotion rules are more complicated.<\/p>\n<p>Using the <strong>integral promotion<\/strong> rules, the following conversions can be made:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>signed char or signed short can be converted to int.<\/li>\n<li>unsigned char, char8_t, and unsigned short can be converted to int if int can hold the entire range of the type, or unsigned int otherwise.<\/li>\n<li>If char is signed by default, it follows the signed char conversion rules above.  If it is unsigned by default, it follows the unsigned char conversion rules above.<\/li>\n<li>bool can be converted to int, with false becoming 0 and true becoming 1.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Assuming an 8 bit byte and an <code>int<\/code> size of 4 bytes or larger (which is typical these days), the above basically means that <code>bool<\/code>, <code>char<\/code>, <code>signed char<\/code>, <code>unsigned char<\/code>, <code>signed short<\/code>, and <code>unsigned short<\/code> all get promoted to <code>int<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few other integral promotion rules that are used less often.  These can be found at <a href=\"https:\/\/en.cppreference.com\/w\/cpp\/language\/implicit_conversion#Integral_promotion\">https:\/\/en.cppreference.com\/w\/cpp\/language\/implicit_conversion#Integral_promotion<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In most cases, this lets us write a function taking an <code>int<\/code> parameter, and then use it with a wide variety of other integral types.  For example:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\nvoid printInt(int x)\r\n{\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; '\\n';\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    printInt(2);\r\n\r\n    short s{ 3 }; \/\/ there is no short literal suffix, so we'll use a variable for this one\r\n    printInt(s); \/\/ numeric promotion of short to int\r\n\r\n    printInt('a'); \/\/ numeric promotion of char to int\r\n    printInt(true); \/\/ numeric promotion of bool to int\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>There are two things worth noting here.  First, on some architectures (e.g. with 2 byte ints) it is possible for some of the unsigned integral types to be promoted to <code>unsigned int<\/code> rather than <code>int<\/code>.  <\/p>\n<p>Second, some narrower unsigned types (such as <code>unsigned char<\/code>) may be promoted to larger signed types (such as <code>int<\/code>).  So while integral promotion is value-preserving, it does not necessarily preserve the signedness (signed\/unsigned) of the type.<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Not all widening conversions are numeric promotions<\/p>\n<p>Some widening type conversions (such as <code>char<\/code> to <code>short<\/code>, or <code>int<\/code> to <code>long<\/code>) are not considered to be numeric promotions in C++ (they are <code>numeric conversions<\/code>, which we&#8217;ll cover shortly in lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/numeric-conversions\/\">10.3 -- Numeric conversions<\/a>).  This is because such conversions do not assist in the goal of converting smaller types to larger types that can be processed more efficiently.<\/p>\n<p>The distinction is mostly academic.  However, in certain cases, the compiler will favor numeric promotions over numeric conversions.  We&#8217;ll see examples where this makes a difference when we cover function overload resolution (in upcoming lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/function-overload-resolution-and-ambiguous-matches\/\">11.3 -- Function overload resolution and ambiguous matches<\/a>).<\/p>\n<div class=\"prevnext\"><div class=\"prevnext-inline\">\n\t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/numeric-conversions\/\">\n <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-next\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-chevron-circle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Next lesson<\/div>\n      <div class=\"nav-button-lesson\">\n        <span class=\"nav-button-lesson-number\">10.3<\/span>Numeric conversions\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div><\/a>\n  \t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"\/\">\n  <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-index\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-home\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Back to table of contents<\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div><\/a>\n  \t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/implicit-type-conversion\/\">\n  <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-prev\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-chevron-circle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Previous lesson<\/div>\n      <div class=\"nav-button-lesson\">\n        <span class=\"nav-button-lesson-number\">10.1<\/span>Implicit type conversion\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div><\/a>\n  <\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In lesson , we noted that C++ has minimum size guarantees for each of the fundamental types.
