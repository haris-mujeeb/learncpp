Statements are often terminated by a semicolon.<\/p>\n<p>A <strong>function<\/strong> is a collection of statements that execute sequentially.  Every C++ program must include a special function named <em>main<\/em>.  When you run your program, execution starts at the top of the <em>main<\/em> function.<\/p>\n<p>In programming, the name of a function (or object, type, template, etc\u2026) is called its <strong>identifier<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The rules that govern how elements of the C++ language are constructed is called <strong>syntax<\/strong>.  A <strong>syntax error<\/strong> occurs when you violate the grammatical rules of the language.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Comments<\/strong> allow the programmer to leave notes in the code.  C++ supports two types of comments.  Line comments start with a <code>\/\/<\/code> and run to the end of the line.  Block comments start with a <code>\/*<\/code> and go to the paired <code>*\/<\/code> symbol.  Don&#8217;t nest block comments.<\/p>\n<p>You can use comments to temporarily disable lines or sections of code.  This is called commenting out your code.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Data<\/strong> is any information that can be moved, processed, or stored by a computer.  A single piece of data is called a <strong>value<\/strong>.  Common examples of values include letters (e.g. <code>a<\/code>), numbers (e.g. <code>5<\/code>), and text (e.g. <code>Hello<\/code>).<\/p>\n<p>A variable is a named piece of memory that we can use to store values.  In order to create a variable, we use a statement called a <strong>definition statement<\/strong>.  When the program is run, each defined variable is <strong>instantiated<\/strong>, which means it is assigned a memory address.<\/p>\n<p>A <strong>data type<\/strong> tells the compiler how to interpret a piece of data into a meaningful value.  An <strong>integer<\/strong> is a number that can be written without a fractional component, such as 4, 27, 0, -2, or -12.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Copy assignment<\/strong> (via operator=) can be used to assign an already created variable a value.<\/p>\n<p>The process of specifying an initial value for an object is called <strong>initialization<\/strong>, and the syntax used to initialize an object is called an <strong>initializer<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Simplified, C++ supports 6 basic types of initialization:<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-table-wrapper\">\n<table class=\"cpp-table\">\n<tr>\n<th> Initialization Type  <\/th>\n<th> Example <\/th>\n<th> Note <\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td> Default-initialization <\/td>\n<td> int x; <\/td>\n<td> In most cases, leaves variable with indeterminate value <\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td> Copy-initialization  <\/td>\n<td> int x = 5; <\/td>\n<td> <\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td> Direct-initialization <\/td>\n<td> int x ( 5 ); <\/td>\n<td> <\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td> Direct-list-initialization <\/td>\n<td> int x { 5 }; <\/td>\n<td> Narrowing conversions disallowed <\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td> Copy-list-initialization <\/td>\n<td> int x = { 5 }; <\/td>\n<td> Narrowing conversions disallowed <\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td> Value-initialization <\/td>\n<td> int x {}; <\/td>\n<td> Usually performs zero-initialization <\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<\/div>\n<p>Direct-initialization is sometimes called parenthesis-initialization, and list-initialization (including value-initialization) is sometimes called uniform -initialization or brace-initialization.  You should prefer brace-initialization over the other initialization forms, and prefer initialization over assignment.<\/p>\n<p>Although you can define multiple variables in a single statement, it&#8217;s better to define and initialize each variable on its own line, in a separate statement.<\/p>\n<p><strong>std::cout<\/strong> and <code>operator&lt;&lt;<\/code> allow us to output the result of an expression to the console.<\/p>\n<p><strong>std::endl<\/strong> outputs a newline character, forcing the console cursor to move to the next line, and flushes any pending output to the console.  The <code>'\\n'<\/code> character also outputs a newline character, but lets the system decide when to flush the output.  Be careful not to use <code>'\/n'<\/code> (forward slash).<\/p>\n<p><strong>std::cin<\/strong> and <code>operator&gt;&gt;<\/code> allow us to get a value from the keyboard.<\/p>\n<p>A variable that has not been given a value is called an <strong>uninitialized variable<\/strong>.  Trying to get the value of an uninitialized variable will result in <strong>undefined behavior<\/strong>, which can manifest in any number of ways.<\/p>\n<p>C++ reserves a set of names called <strong>keywords<\/strong>.  These have special meaning within the language and may not be used as variable names.<\/p>\n<p>A <strong>literal constant<\/strong> is a fixed value inserted directly into the source code.  Examples are 5 and &#8220;Hello world!&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>An <strong>operation<\/strong> is a process involving zero or more input values, called <strong>operands<\/strong>.  The specific operation to be performed is denoted by the provided <strong>operator<\/strong>.  The result of an operation produces an output value.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unary<\/strong> operators take one operand.  <strong>Binary<\/strong> operators take two operands, often called left and right.  <strong>Ternary<\/strong> operators take three operands.  <strong>Nullary<\/strong> operators take zero operands.<\/p>\n<p>An <strong>expression<\/strong> is a sequence of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that are evaluated to produce a single output value.  The calculation of this output value is called <strong>evaluation<\/strong>.  The value produced is the <strong>result<\/strong> of the expression.<\/p>\n<p>An <strong>expression statement<\/strong> is an expression that has been turned into a statement by placing a semicolon at the end of the expression.<\/p>\n<p>When writing programs, add a few lines or a function, compile, resolve any errors, and make sure it works.  Don&#8217;t wait until you&#8217;ve written an entire program before compiling it for the first time!<\/p>\n<p>Focus on getting your code working.  Once you are sure you are going to keep some bit of code, then you can spend time removing (or commenting out) temporary\/debugging code, adding comments, handling error cases, formatting your code, ensuring best practices are followed, removing redundant logic, etc&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>First-draft programs are often messy and imperfect.  Most code requires cleanup and refinement to get to great!<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Quiz time<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-quiz-question\" style=\"clear: both\">Question #1<\/p>\n<p>What is the difference between initialization and assignment?  How many times can a variable be initialized or assigned a value?<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"solution_link_show\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"cppSolutionToggle(document.getElementById('cpp_solution_id_0'), this, 'Show Solution', 'Hide Solution')\">Show Solution<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"wpsolution\" id=\"cpp_solution_id_0\" style=\"display:none\">\nInitialization provides a variable with an initial value (at the point of creation).  Assignment gives a variable a new value after the variable has already been defined.<\/p>\n<p>Since a variable is only created once, it can only be initialized once.  A variable can be assigned a value as many times as desired.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"cpp-quiz-question cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Question #2<\/p>\n<p>When does undefined behavior occur?
