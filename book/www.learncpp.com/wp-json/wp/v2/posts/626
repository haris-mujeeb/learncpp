On such a machine, this program will print <code>32768<\/code>.  However, on a machine where <code>int<\/code> is 16-bits, the value <code>32768<\/code> does not fit within the range of a 16-bit integer (which has range -32,768 to 32,767).  On such a machine, <code>x = x + 1<\/code> will cause overflow, and the value <code>-32768<\/code> will be stored in <code>x<\/code> and then printed.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, if you assume an <code>int<\/code> is only 16-bits to ensure your program will behave on all architectures, then the range of values you can safely store in an <code>int<\/code> is significantly limited.  And on systems where <code>int<\/code> is actually 32-bits, you&#8217;re not making use of half of the memory allocated per <code>int<\/code>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Key insight<\/p>\n<p>In most cases, we only instantiate a small number of <code>int<\/code> variables at a time, and these are typically destroyed at the end of the function in which they are created.  In such cases, wasting 2 bytes of memory per variable isn&#8217;t a concern (the limited range is a bigger issue).  However, in cases where our program allocates millions of <code>int<\/code> variables, wasting 2 bytes of memory per variable can have a significant impact on the program&#8217;s overall memory usage.\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Why isn&#8217;t the size of the integer types fixed?<\/p>\n<p>The short answer is that this goes back to the early days of C, when computers were slow and performance was of the utmost concern.  C opted to intentionally leave the size of an integer open so that the compiler implementers could pick a size for <code>int<\/code> that performs best on the target computer architecture.  That way, programmers could just use <code>int<\/code> without having to worry about whether they could be using something more performant.<\/p>\n<p>By modern standards, the lack of consistent ranges for the various integral types sucks (especially in a language designed to be portable).<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Fixed-width integers<\/p>\n<p>To address the above issues, C++11 provides an alternate set of integer types that are guaranteed to be the same size on any architecture.

Thus on most modern systems, the 8-bit fixed-width integral types will behave like char types.<\/p>\n<p>As a quick teaser:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include &lt;cstdint&gt; \/\/ for fixed-width integers\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    std::int8_t x { 65 };   \/\/ initialize 8-bit integral type with value 65\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; '\\n'; \/\/ You're probably expecting this to print 65\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Although you&#8217;re probably expecting the above program to print <code>65<\/code>, it most likely won&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>We discuss what this example actually prints (and how to ensure it always prints <code>65<\/code>) in lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/introduction-to-type-conversion-and-static_cast\/\">4.12 -- Introduction to type conversion and static_cast<\/a>, after we cover chars (and how they print) in lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/chars\/\">4.11 -- Chars<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightredbackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Warning<\/p>\n<p>The 8-bit fixed-width integer types are often treated like chars instead of integer values (and this may vary per system).  The 16-bit and wider integral types are not subject to this issue.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">For advanced readers<\/p>\n<p>The fixed-width integers actually don&#8217;t define new types -- they are just aliases for existing integral types with the desired size.  For each fixed-width type, the implementation (the compiler and standard library) gets to determine which existing type is aliased.  As an example, on a platform where <code>int<\/code> is 32-bits, <code>std::int32_t<\/code> will be an alias for <code>int<\/code>.  On a system where <code>int<\/code> is 16-bits (and <code>long<\/code> is 32-bits), <code>std::int32_t<\/code> will be an alias for <code>long<\/code> instead.<\/p>\n<p>So what about the 8-bit fixed-width types?<\/p>\n<p>In most cases, <code>std::int8_t<\/code> is an alias for <code>signed char<\/code> because it is the only available 8-bit signed integral type (<code>bool<\/code> and <code>char<\/code> are not considered to be signed integral types).  And when this is the case, <code>std::int8_t<\/code> will behave just like a char on that platform.<\/p>\n<p>However, in rare cases, if a platform has an implementation-specific 8-bit signed integral type, the implementation may decide to make <code>std::int8_t<\/code> an alias for that type instead.  In that case, <code>std::int8_t<\/code> will behave like that type, which may be more like an int than a char.<\/p>\n<p><code>std::uint8_t<\/code> behaves similarly.\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Other fixed-width downsides<\/p>\n<p>The fixed-width integers have some potential downsides:<\/p>\n<p>First, the fixed-width integers are not guaranteed to be defined on all architectures.  They only exist on systems where there are fundamental integral types that match their widths and following a certain binary representation.  Your program will fail to compile on any such architecture that does not support a fixed-width integer that your program is using.  However, given that modern architectures have standardized around 8\/16\/32\/64-bit variables, this is unlikely to be a problem unless your program needs to be portable to some exotic mainframe or embedded architectures.<\/p>\n<p>Second, if you use a fixed-width integer, it may be slower than a wider type on some architectures.  For example, if you need an integer that is guaranteed to be 32-bits, you might decide to use <code>std::int32_t<\/code>, but your CPU might actually be faster at processing 64-bit integers.  However, just because your CPU can process a given type faster doesn&#8217;t mean your program will be faster overall -- modern programs are often constrained by memory usage rather than CPU, and the larger memory footprint may slow your program more than the faster CPU processing accelerates it.  It&#8217;s hard to know without actually measuring.<\/p>\n<p>These are just minor quibbles though.<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Fast and least integral types <span class=\"cpp-section-pill cpp-section-optional\">Optional<\/span><\/p>\n<p>To help address the above downsides, C++ also defines two alternative sets of integers that are guaranteed to exist.<\/p>\n<p>The fast types (std::int_fast#_t and std::uint_fast#_t) provide the fastest signed\/unsigned integer type with a width of at least # bits (where # = 8, 16, 32, or 64).  For example, <code>std::int_fast32_t<\/code> will give you the fastest signed integer type that&#8217;s at least 32-bits.  By fastest, we mean the integral type that can be processed most quickly by the CPU.<\/p>\n<p>The least types (std::int_least#_t and std::uint_least#_t) provide the smallest signed\/unsigned integer type with a width of at least # bits (where # = 8, 16, 32, or 64).  For example, <code>std::uint_least32_t<\/code> will give you the smallest unsigned integer type that&#8217;s at least 32-bits.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example from the author&#8217;s Visual Studio (32-bit console application):<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include &lt;cstdint&gt; \/\/ for fast and least types\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n\tstd::cout &lt;&lt; \"least 8:  \" &lt;&lt; sizeof(std::int_least8_t)  * 8 &lt;&lt; \" bits\\n\";\r\n\tstd::cout &lt;&lt; \"least 16: \" &lt;&lt; sizeof(std::int_least16_t) * 8 &lt;&lt; \" bits\\n\";\r\n\tstd::cout &lt;&lt; \"least 32: \" &lt;&lt; sizeof(std::int_least32_t) * 8 &lt;&lt; \" bits\\n\";\r\n\tstd::cout &lt;&lt; '\\n';\r\n\tstd::cout &lt;&lt; \"fast 8:  \"  &lt;&lt; sizeof(std::int_fast8_t)   * 8 &lt;&lt; \" bits\\n\";\r\n\tstd::cout &lt;&lt; \"fast 16: \"  &lt;&lt; sizeof(std::int_fast16_t)  * 8 &lt;&lt; \" bits\\n\";\r\n\tstd::cout &lt;&lt; \"fast 32: \"  &lt;&lt; sizeof(std::int_fast32_t)  * 8 &lt;&lt; \" bits\\n\";\r\n\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This produced the result:<\/p>\n<pre>\nleast 8:  8 bits\r\nleast 16: 16 bits\r\nleast 32: 32 bits\r\n\r\nfast 8:  8 bits\r\nfast 16: 32 bits\r\nfast 32: 32 bits\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>You can see that <code>std::int_least16_t<\/code> is 16-bits, whereas <code>std::int_fast16_t<\/code> is actually 32-bits.  This is because on the author&#8217;s machine, 32-bit integers are faster to process than 16-bit integers.<\/p>\n<p>As another example, let&#8217;s assume we&#8217;re on an architecture that has only 16-bit and 64-bit integral types.  <code>std::int32_t<\/code> would not exist, whereas <code>std::least_int32_t<\/code> (and <code>std::fast_int32_t<\/code>) would be 64 bits.<\/p>\n<p>However, these fast and least integers have their own downsides.  First, not many programmers actually use them, and a lack of familiarity can lead to errors.  Then the fast types can also lead to memory wastage, as their actual size may be significantly larger than indicated by their name.<\/p>\n<p>Most seriously, because the size of the fast\/least integers is implementation-defined, your program may exhibit different behaviors on architectures where they resolve to different sizes.  For example:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include &lt;cstdint&gt;\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    std::uint_fast16_t sometype { 0 };\r\n    sometype = sometype - 1; \/\/ intentionally overflow to invoke wraparound behavior\r\n\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; sometype &lt;&lt; '\\n';\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This code will produce different results depending on whether <code>std::uint_fast16_t<\/code> is 16, 32, or 64 bits!  This is exactly what we were trying to avoid by using fixed-width integers in the first place!<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightgreenbackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Best practice<\/p>\n<p>Avoid the fast and least integral types because they may exhibit different behaviors on architectures where they resolve to different sizes.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Best practices for integral types<\/p>\n<p>Given the various pros and cons of the fundamental integral types, the fixed-width integral types, the fast\/least integral types, and signed\/unsigned challenges, there is little consensus on integral best practices.<\/p>\n<p>Our stance is that it&#8217;s better to be correct than fast, and better to fail at compile time than runtime.  Therefore, if you need an integral type with a guaranteed range, we recommend avoiding the fast\/least types in favor of the fixed-width types.  If you later discover the need to support an esoteric platform for which a specific fixed-width integral type won&#8217;t compile, then you can decide how to migrate your program (and thoroughly retest) at that point.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightgreenbackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Best practice<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prefer <code>int<\/code> when the size of the integer doesn&#8217;t matter (e.g. the number will always fit within the range of a 2-byte signed integer).

Thus, creating an object with a size (in bytes) larger than the largest value an object of type <code>std::size_t<\/code> can hold is invalid (and will cause a compile error).<\/p>\n<p>For example, let&#8217;s assume that <code>std::size_t<\/code> has a size of 4 bytes on our system.  An unsigned 4-byte integral type has range 0 to 4,294,967,295.  Therefore, a 4-byte <code>std::size_t<\/code> object can hold any value from 0 to 4,294,967,295.  Any object with a byte-size of 0 to 4,294,967,295 could have it&#8217;s size returned in a value of type <code>std::size_t<\/code>, so this is fine.  However, if the byte-size of an object were larger than 4,294,967,295 bytes, then <code>sizeof<\/code> would not be able to return the size of that object accurately, as the value would be outside the range of a <code>std::size_t<\/code>.

In the 32-bit and 64-bit era, this is rarely an issue, and therefore not something you generally need to worry about.<\/p>\n<div class=\"prevnext\"><div class=\"prevnext-inline\">\n\t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/introduction-to-scientific-notation\/\">\n <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-next\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-chevron-circle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Next lesson<\/div>\n      <div class=\"nav-button-lesson\">\n        <span class=\"nav-button-lesson-number\">4.7<\/span>Introduction to scientific notation\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div><\/a>\n  \t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"\/\">\n  <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-index\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-home\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Back to table of contents<\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div><\/a>\n  \t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/unsigned-integers-and-why-to-avoid-them\/\">\n  <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-prev\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-chevron-circle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Previous lesson<\/div>\n      <div class=\"nav-button-lesson\">\n        <span class=\"nav-button-lesson-number\">4.5<\/span>Unsigned integers, and why to avoid them\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div><\/a>\n  <\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the previous lessons on integers, we covered that C++ only guarantees that integer variables will have a minimum size &#8212; but they could be larger, depending on the target system.
