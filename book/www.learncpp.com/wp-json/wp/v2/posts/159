Your breakfast cereal comes in a box, the pages in your book come inside a cover and binding, and you might store any number of items in containers in your garage.  Without containers, it would be extremely inconvenient to work with many of these objects.  Imagine trying to read a book that didn&#8217;t have any sort of binding, or eat cereal that didn&#8217;t come in a box without using a bowl.  It would be a mess.  The value the container provides is largely in its ability to help organize and store items that are put inside it.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, a <strong>container class<\/strong> is a class designed to hold and organize multiple instances of another type (either another class, or a fundamental type).  There are many different kinds of container classes, each of which has various advantages, disadvantages, and restrictions in their use.  By far the most commonly used container in programming is the array, which you have already seen many examples of.  Although C++ has built-in array functionality, programmers will often use an array container class (std::array or std::vector) instead because of the additional benefits they provide.  Unlike built-in arrays, array container classes generally provide dynamic resizing (when elements are added or removed), remember their size when they are passed to functions, and do bounds-checking.  This not only makes array container classes more convenient than normal arrays, but safer too.<\/p>\n<p>Container classes typically implement a fairly standardized minimal set of functionality.  Most well-defined containers will include functions that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create an empty container (via a constructor)\n<li>Insert a new object into the container\n<li>Remove an object from the container\n<li>Report the number of objects currently in the container\n<li>Empty the container of all objects\n<li>Provide access to the stored objects\n<li>Sort the elements (optional)\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sometimes certain container classes will omit some of this functionality.  For example, arrays container classes often omit the insert and remove functions because they are slow and the class designer does not want to encourage their use.<\/p>\n<p>Container classes implement a member-of relationship.  For example, elements of an array are members-of (belong to) the array.  Note that we&#8217;re using &#8220;member-of&#8221; in the conventional sense, not the C++ class member sense.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Types of containers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Container classes generally come in two different varieties.  <strong>Value containers<\/strong> are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/102-composition\/\">compositions<\/a> that store copies of the objects that they are holding (and thus are responsible for creating and destroying those copies).  <strong>Reference containers<\/strong> are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/103-aggregation\/\">aggregations<\/a> that store pointers or references to other objects (and thus are not responsible for creation or destruction of those objects).<\/p>\n<p>Unlike in real life, where containers can hold whatever types of objects you put in them, in C++, containers typically only hold one type of data.  For example, if you have an array of integers, it will only hold integers.  Unlike some other languages, many C++ containers do not allow you to arbitrarily mix types.  If you need containers to hold integers and doubles, you will generally have to write two separate containers to do this (or use templates, which is an advanced C++ feature).  Despite the restrictions on their use, containers are immensely useful, and they make programming easier, safer, and faster.<\/p>\n<p><strong>An array container class<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In this example, we are going to write an integer array class from scratch that implements most of the common functionality that containers should have.  This array class is going to be a value container, which will hold copies of the elements it&#8217;s organizing.  As the name suggests, the container will hold an array of integers, similar to <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt;<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s create the IntArray.h file:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#ifndef INTARRAY_H\r\n#define INTARRAY_H\r\n\r\nclass IntArray\r\n{\r\n};\r\n\r\n#endif<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Our IntArray is going to need to keep track of two values: the data itself, and the size of the array.  Because we want our array to be able to change in size, we&#8217;ll have to do some dynamic allocation, which means we&#8217;ll have to use a pointer to store the data.<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#ifndef INTARRAY_H\r\n#define INTARRAY_H\r\n\r\nclass IntArray\r\n{\r\nprivate:\r\n    int m_length{};\r\n    int* m_data{};\r\n};\r\n\r\n#endif<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Now we need to add some constructors that will allow us to create IntArrays.  We are going to add two constructors: one that constructs an empty array, and one that will allow us to construct an array of a predetermined size.<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#ifndef INTARRAY_H\r\n#define INTARRAY_H\r\n\r\n#include &lt;cassert&gt; \/\/ for assert()\r\n#include &lt;cstddef&gt; \/\/ for std::size_t\r\n\r\nclass IntArray\r\n{\r\nprivate:\r\n    int m_length{};\r\n    int* m_data{};\r\n\r\npublic:\r\n    IntArray() = default;\r\n\r\n    IntArray(int length):\r\n        m_length{ length }\r\n    {\r\n        assert(length &gt;= 0);\r\n\r\n        if (length &gt; 0)\r\n            m_data = new int[static_cast&lt;std::size_t&gt;(length)]{};\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\n#endif<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>We&#8217;ll also need some functions to help us clean up IntArrays.  First, we&#8217;ll write a destructor, which simply deallocates any dynamically allocated data.  Second, we&#8217;ll write a function called erase(), which will erase the array and set the length to 0.<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">    ~IntArray()\r\n    {\r\n        delete[] m_data;\r\n        \/\/ we don't need to set m_data to null or m_length to 0 here, since the object will be destroyed immediately after this function anyway\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void erase()\r\n    {\r\n        delete[] m_data;\r\n\r\n        \/\/ We need to make sure we set m_data to nullptr here, otherwise it will\r\n        \/\/ be left pointing at deallocated memory!\r\n        m_data = nullptr;\r\n        m_length = 0;\r\n    }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s overload the [] operator so we can access the elements of the array.  We should ensure the index parameter has a valid value, which we can do by using the assert() function.  We&#8217;ll also add an access function to return the length of the array.  Here&#8217;s everything so far:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#ifndef INTARRAY_H\r\n#define INTARRAY_H\r\n\r\n#include &lt;cassert&gt; \/\/ for assert()\r\n#include &lt;cstddef&gt; \/\/ for std::size_t\r\n\r\nclass IntArray\r\n{\r\nprivate:\r\n    int m_length{};\r\n    int* m_data{};\r\n\r\npublic:\r\n    IntArray() = default;\r\n\r\n    IntArray(int length):\r\n        m_length{ length }\r\n    {\r\n        assert(length &gt;= 0);\r\n\r\n        if (length &gt; 0)\r\n            m_data = new int[static_cast&lt;std::size_t&gt;(length)]{};\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ~IntArray()\r\n    {\r\n        delete[] m_data;\r\n        \/\/ we don't need to set m_data to null or m_length to 0 here, since the object will be destroyed immediately after this function anyway\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void erase()\r\n    {\r\n        delete[] m_data;\r\n        \/\/ We need to make sure we set m_data to nullptr here, otherwise it will\r\n        \/\/ be left pointing at deallocated memory!\r\n        m_data = nullptr;\r\n        m_length = 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    int&amp; operator[](int index)\r\n    {\r\n        assert(index &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; index &lt; m_length);\r\n        return m_data[index];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    int getLength() const { return m_length; }\r\n};\r\n\r\n#endif<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>At this point, we already have an IntArray class that we can use.  We can allocate IntArrays of a given size, and we can use the [] operator to retrieve or change the value of the elements.<\/p>\n<p>However, there are still a few thing we can&#8217;t do with our IntArray.  We still can&#8217;t change its size, still can&#8217;t insert or delete elements, and we still can&#8217;t sort it.  Copying the array will also cause problems, since that will shallow copy the data pointer.<\/p>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s write some code that will allow us to resize an array.  We are going to write two different functions to do this.  The first function, reallocate(), will destroy any existing elements in the array when it is resized, but it will be fast.  The second function, resize(), will keep any existing elements in the array when it is resized, but it will be slow.<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include &lt;algorithm&gt; \/\/ for std::copy_n\r\n\r\n    \/\/ reallocate resizes the array.

For example, instead of using IntArray, you&#8217;re better off using <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt;<\/code>.  It&#8217;s battle tested, efficient, and plays nicely with the other classes in the standard library.  But sometimes you need a specialized container class that doesn&#8217;t exist in the standard library, so it&#8217;s good to know how to create your own when you need to.<\/p>\n<div class=\"prevnext\"><div class=\"prevnext-inline\">\n\t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/stdinitializer_list\/\">\n <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-next\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-chevron-circle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Next lesson<\/div>\n      <div class=\"nav-button-lesson\">\n        <span class=\"nav-button-lesson-number\">23.7<\/span>std::initializer_list\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div><\/a>\n  \t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"\/\">\n  <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-index\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-home\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Back to table of contents<\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div><\/a>\n  \t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/dependencies\/\">\n  <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-prev\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-chevron-circle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Previous lesson<\/div>\n      <div class=\"nav-button-lesson\">\n        <span class=\"nav-button-lesson-number\">23.5<\/span>Dependencies\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div><\/a>\n  <\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In real life, we use containers all the time.
