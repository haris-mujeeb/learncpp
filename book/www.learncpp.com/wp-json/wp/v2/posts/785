That means those users who post code in comments without using the code tags should have their code come out looking a bit better.  Please let me know if you discover any issues with posting comments as a result!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update on 12\/30<\/strong>: Comments have been re-added to the tutorials per request.  We&#8217;re trying out some new anti-spam filters so we&#8217;ll see how that goes.  I&#8217;ll be going through each of the articles, manually cleaning up any spam that leaked through the previous filter, and deleting off-topic\/useless comments.  This will probably take a few days\/weeks since there are over six thousand comments to read through!<\/p>\n<p><!-- disable adinserter 1 --><br \/>\n<!-- disable adinserter 2 --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hey all, In order to clean up the site infrastructure and address some security and spam issues, we&#8217;ve migrated the site to a new (faster) server, and essentially rebuilt the site from the ground up.
