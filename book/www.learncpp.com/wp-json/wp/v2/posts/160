Try running in <em>Start Without Debugging (Ctrl-F5)<\/em> mode.\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Q: I ran my program and get a window but no output.<\/p>\n<p>Your virus scanner or anti-malware may be blocking execution.  Try disabling it temporarily and see if that&#8217;s the issue.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Q: My program compiles but it isn&#8217;t working correctly.  What do I do?<\/p>\n<p>Debug it!  There are tips on how to diagnose and debug your programs later in chapter 3.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">General compile-time issues<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Q: When I compile my program, I get an error about unresolved external symbol _main or _WinMain@16<\/p>\n<p>This means your compiler can&#8217;t find your main() function.  All programs must include a main() function.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few things to check:<br \/>\na) Does your code include a function named main?<br \/>\nb) Is main spelled correctly?<br \/>\nc) When you compile your program, do you see the file that contains function main() get compiled?  If not, either move the main() function to one that is, or add the file to your project (see lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/programs-with-multiple-code-files\/\">2.8 -- Programs with multiple code files<\/a> for more information about how to do this)<\/a>.<br \/>\nd) Did you create a console project?  Try creating a new console project.\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Q: When I compile my program, I get an error that main is already defined, or about multiple definitions for main<\/p>\n<p>A C++ program is only allowed to have a single function named <code>main<\/code>.  Your C++ program has more than one.  Examine the files in your project and delete all <code>main<\/code> functions except one.\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Q: I&#8217;m trying to use C++11\/14\/17\/XX functionality and it doesn&#8217;t work<\/p>\n<p>If your compiler is old, it may not support these more recent additions to the language.  In that case, upgrade your compiler.<\/p>\n<p>For modern IDEs\/compilers, your compiler may be defaulting to an older language standard.  We cover how to change your language standard in lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/configuring-your-compiler-choosing-a-language-standard\/\">0.12 -- Configuring your compiler: Choosing a language standard<\/a>.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Q: When I compile my program, I get an error that it cannot open the .exe for writing<\/p>\n<p>This means the linker is trying to create your executable, but it can&#8217;t.  This can happen for quite a few reasons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most commonly, the .exe is currently running.  A running executable can&#8217;t be replaced while it is running.  Close the running .exe and recompile.\n<\/li>\n<li>Your antivirus or malware protection is preventing the executable from being created or replaced.\n<\/li>\n<li>The .exe already exists and is currently locked for some other reason.  Try rebooting (to force any locks to be released), then recompile.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In Visual Studio, this is error LNK1168.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Q: When trying to use cin, cout, or endl, the compiler says cin, cout, or endl is an &#8216;undeclared identifier&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>First, make sure you have included the following line near the top of your file:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include &lt;iostream&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Second, make sure each use of cin, cout, and endl are prefixed by &#8220;std::&#8221;.  For example:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Broccoli\" &lt;&lt; std::endl;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>If this doesn&#8217;t fix your issue, then it may be that your compiler is out of date, or the install is corrupted.  Try reinstalling and\/or upgrading to the latest version of your compiler.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Q: When trying to use endl to end a printed line, the compiler says end1 is an &#8216;undeclared identifier&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Make sure you do not mistake the letter l (lower case L) in endl for the number 1.  endl is all letters.  Make sure your editor is using a font that makes clear the differences between the letter lower case L, upper case i, and the number 1.  Also the letter capital o and the number zero can easily be confused in many non-programming fonts.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Visual Studio issues<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Q: When compiling with Microsoft Visual C++, you get a C1010 fatal error, with an error message like &#34;c:\\vcprojects\\test.cpp(263) :fatal error C1010: unexpected end of file while looking for precompiled header directive&#34;<\/p>\n<p>This error occurs when the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler is set to use precompiled headers but one (or more) of your C++ code files does not #include &#8220;stdafx.h&#8221; or #include &#8220;pch.h&#8221; as the first line of the code file.<\/p>\n<p>Our suggested fix is to turn off precompiled headers, which we show how to do in lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/compiling-your-first-program\/\">0.7 -- Compiling your first program<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like to keep precompiled headers turned on, to fix this problem, simply locate the file(s) producing the error (in the above error, test.cpp is the culprit), and add the following line at the very top of the file(s):<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include \"pch.h\"<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Older versions of Visual Studio use &#8220;stdafx.h&#8221; instead of &#8220;pch.h&#8221;, so if pch.h doesn&#8217;t resolve the issue, try stdafx.h.<\/p>\n<p>Note that for programs with multiple files, every C++ code file needs to start with this line.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Q: Visual Studio gives an error like: &#34;1MSVCRTD.lib(exe_winmain.obj) : error LNK2022: unresolved external symbol _WinMain@16 referenced in function &#34;int __cdecl invoke_main(void)&#34; (?invoke_main@@YAHXZ)&#34;<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve likely created a Windows graphical application rather than a console application.  Recreate your project, and make sure to create it as a Windows (or Win32) <em>Console<\/em> project.\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Q: When I compile my program, I get a warning about &#34;Cannot find or open the PDB file&#34;<\/p>\n<p>This is a warning, not an error, so it shouldn&#8217;t impact your program.  However, it is annoying.  To fix it, go into the Debug menu -> Options and Settings -> Symbols, and check &#8220;Microsoft Symbol Server&#8221;.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Something else<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Q: I have some other problem that I can&#8217;t figure out.  How can I get an answer quickly?<\/p>\n<p>As you progress through the material, you\u2019ll undoubtedly have questions or run into unexpected problems.  What to do next depends on your problem.  But in general, there are a few things you can try.<\/p>\n<p>First, <strong>ask a search engine<\/strong>.  Find a good way to phrase your question and do a search.  If you are searching an error message, paste in the exact error message using quotes (exclude any filenames or line numbers).  Odds are someone has already asked the same question and there is an answer waiting for you.<\/p>\n<p>Second, <strong>ask an AI<\/strong> like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bing.com\/chat\">ChatGPT via Bing<\/a>.  Start your question with &#8220;In C++,&#8221; to get a C++ specific answer.  Some ideas for things you can ask for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An explanation of some concept (e.g. &#8220;In C++, what is a local variable?&#8221;).\n<\/li>\n<li>The difference between two things (e.g. &#8220;In C++, what is the difference between a pointer and a reference?&#8221;)\n<\/li>\n<li>A demonstration of a concept (e.g. &#8220;In C++, write a short program that adds two numbers&#8221;)\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note that AIs may return inaccurate or outdated information, and the programs they write will probably not follow modern best practices.<\/p>\n<p>If the above fails, <strong>ask on a Q&#038;A board<\/strong>.  There are websites designed for programming questions and answers, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stackoverflow.com\">Stack Overflow<\/a>.  Try posting your question there.  Remember to be thorough about what your problem is, and include all relevant information like what OS you&#8217;re on and what IDE you&#8217;re using.\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"prevnext\"><div class=\"prevnext-inline\">\n\t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/configuring-your-compiler-build-configurations\/\">\n <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-next\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-chevron-circle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Next lesson<\/div>\n      <div class=\"nav-button-lesson\">\n        <span class=\"nav-button-lesson-number\">0.9<\/span>Configuring your compiler: Build configurations\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div><\/a>\n  \t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"\/\">\n  <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-index\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-home\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Back to table of contents<\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div><\/a>\n  \t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/compiling-your-first-program\/\">\n  <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-prev\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-chevron-circle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Previous lesson<\/div>\n      <div class=\"nav-button-lesson\">\n        <span class=\"nav-button-lesson-number\">0.7<\/span>Compiling your first program\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div><\/a>\n  <\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this section, we&#8217;ll address some of the common issues that new programmers seem to run across with fairly high probability.
