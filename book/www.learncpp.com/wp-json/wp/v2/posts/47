We all like to have a little bit of fun, and one of the best ways to do that is through flash type games.<\/p>\n<p>The other day, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpptrader.com\">CppTrader<\/a> introduced me to a little flash game called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gamedesign.jp\/flash\/dice\/dice.html\">Dice Wars<\/a>, and I thought I&#8217;d pass it on to anybody interested.  Dice Wars is very reminiscent of the old board game Risk, only simplified, and playable in under 10 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Because the game does not come with instructions, let me explain how to play here.  The map is divided into a bunch of random territories, each having a random number of adjacencies.  You are the purple territory.  Each territory has a stack of dice on it.  When it is your turn, you can attack adjacent territories by clicking on one of your territories, and then on the adjacent territory you wish to attack.  The dice are rolled, and whoever has a greater total wins.  Ties go to the defender.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of your turn, you get more dice that are randomly dispersed across your territories.  The number of dice you get is equal to the largest number of adjacent territories you own.  So if you had a cluster of 3 territories, and a cluster of 4 territories, you&#8217;d get 4 dice.<\/p>\n<p>The game is extremely simple to play, and you will understand after one game.  But the strategy is subtly complex, and you will be coming up with new tactics even after 10 or more games.<\/p>\n<p>Have fun!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Even though this site is focused on programming, it&#8217;s always good to take a break every once in a while.
