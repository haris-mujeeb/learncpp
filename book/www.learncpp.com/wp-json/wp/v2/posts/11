Ritchie&#8217;s primary goals were to produce a minimalistic language that was easy to compile, allowed efficient access to memory, produced efficient code, and was self-contained (not reliant on other programs).  For a high-level language, C was designed to give the programmer a lot of control, while allowing developers to write a program that could be run on different platforms.<\/p>\n<p>C ended up being so efficient and flexible that in 1973, Ritchie and Ken Thompson rewrote most of the Unix operating system using C.  Many previous operating systems had been written in assembly.  Unlike assembly, which produces programs that can only run on specific CPUs, C has excellent portability, allowing Unix to be easily recompiled on many different types of computers and speeding its adoption.  C and Unix had their fortunes tied together, and C&#8217;s popularity was in part tied to the success of Unix as an operating system.<\/p>\n<p>In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published a book called &#8220;The C Programming Language&#8221;.  This book, which was commonly known as K&#038;R (after the authors&#8217; last names), provided an informal specification for the language and became a de facto standard.  When maximum portability was needed, programmers would stick to the recommendations in K&#038;R, because most compilers at the time were implemented to K&#038;R standards.<\/p>\n<p>In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) formed a committee to establish a formal standard for C.  In 1989 (committees take forever to do anything), they finished, and released the C89 standard, more commonly known as ANSI C.  In 1990 the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted ANSI C (with a few minor modifications).  This version of C became known as C90.  Compilers eventually became ANSI C\/C90 compliant, and programs desiring maximum portability were coded to this standard.<\/p>\n<p>In 1999, the ISO committee released a new version of C informally named C99.  C99 adopted many features which had already made their way into compilers as extensions, or had been implemented in C++.<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">C++<\/p>\n<p>C++ (pronounced &#8220;see plus plus&#8221;) was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs as an extension to C, starting in 1979.  C++ adds many new features to the C language, and is perhaps best thought of as a superset of C, though this is not strictly true (as C99 introduced a few features that do not exist in C++).  C++&#8217;s most notable innovation over C is that it supports object-oriented programming.  As for what an &#8220;object&#8221; is and how it differs from traditional programming methods, well, we&#8217;ll cover that in later chapters.<\/p>\n<p>C++ was standardized in 1998 by the ISO committee.  This means the ISO standards committee approved a document (called a <strong>standards document<\/strong>) that provides a formal description of the C++ language.  The goal of standardization is to help ensure that C++ code behaves consistently across different compilers and platforms.  <\/p>\n<p>A minor update to the language was published in 2003 (informally named C++03).<\/p>\n<p>Five major updates to the C++ language (informally named C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and C++23) have been made since then, each adding additional functionality.  C++11 in particular added a huge number of new capabilities, and is widely considered to be the new baseline version of the language.  Future upgrades to the language are expected every three or so years.<\/p>\n<p>Because the official name of the approved standards is complex (C++20&#8217;s formal name is ISO\/IEC 14882:2020), standards are conventionally referred to by informal names, which include the last two digits of the year of publication (or expected publication).  For example, C++20 refers to the version of the language published in 2020.<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">C and C++&#8217;s philosophy<\/p>\n<p>The underlying design philosophy of C and C++ can be summed up as &#8220;trust the programmer&#8221; -- which is both wonderful and dangerous.  C++ is designed to allow the programmer a high degree of freedom to do what they want.  However, this also means the language often won&#8217;t stop you from doing things that don&#8217;t make sense, because it will assume you&#8217;re doing so for some reason it doesn&#8217;t understand.  There are quite a few pitfalls that new programmers are likely to fall into if caught unaware.  This is one of the primary reasons why knowing what you shouldn&#8217;t do in C\/C++ is almost as important as knowing what you should do.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Q: What is C++ good at?<\/p>\n<p>C++ excels in situations where high performance and precise control over memory and other resources is needed.  Here are a few types of applications that C++ would excel in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Video games\n<\/li>\n<li>Real-time systems (e.g. for transportation, manufacturing, etc&#8230;)\n<\/li>\n<li>High-performance financial applications (e.g. high frequency trading)\n<\/li>\n<li>Graphical applications and simulations\n<\/li>\n<li>Productivity \/ office applications\n<\/li>\n<li>Embedded software\n<\/li>\n<li>Audio and video processing\n<\/li>\n<li>Artificial intelligence and neural networks\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>C++ also has a large number of high-quality 3rd party libraries available, which can shorten development times significantly.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Q: Isn&#8217;t C++ dying?<\/p>\n<p>Nope.  Surveys consistently indicate that C++ is the 2nd or 3rd most popular compiled language (behind Java and sometimes C#, and just ahead of C), and the 5th or 6th most popular language overall (excluding HTML, SQL, and shell scripting languages).<\/p>\n<p>C++ is one of the most popular languages for learning to code, owing to the abundance of teaching resources, the large community, and the number of college courses that teach it.<\/p>\n<p>With language updates every three years, a huge number of useful third party libraries, and dominance in the ever-popular video game industry, C++ continues to thrive.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Q: Do I need to know C before I do these tutorials?<\/p>\n<p>Nope!  It&#8217;s perfectly fine to start with C++, and we&#8217;ll teach you everything you need to know (including pitfalls to avoid) along the way.<\/p>\n<p>Once you know C++, it should be pretty easy to learn standard C if you ever have the need.  These days, C is mostly used for niche use cases: code that runs on embedded devices, when you need to interact with other languages that can only interface with C, etc&#8230;  For most other cases, C++ is recommended.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"prevnext\"><div class=\"prevnext-inline\">\n\t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/introduction-to-cpp-development\/\">\n <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-next\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-chevron-circle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Next lesson<\/div>\n      <div class=\"nav-button-lesson\">\n        <span class=\"nav-button-lesson-number\">0.4<\/span>Introduction to C++ development\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div><\/a>\n  \t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"\/\">\n  <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-index\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-home\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Back to table of contents<\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div><\/a>\n  \t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/introduction-to-programming-languages\/\">\n  <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-prev\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-chevron-circle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Previous lesson<\/div>\n      <div class=\"nav-button-lesson\">\n        <span class=\"nav-button-lesson-number\">0.2<\/span>Introduction to programs and programming languages\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div><\/a>\n  <\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The C language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Telephone laboratories, primarily as a systems programming language (a language to write operating systems with).
