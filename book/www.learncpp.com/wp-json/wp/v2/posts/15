In this lesson, we&#8217;ll cover how to do that, and you&#8217;ll also compile and execute your first program!<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Projects<\/p>\n<p>To write a C++ program inside an IDE, we typically start by creating a new project (we&#8217;ll show you how to do this in a bit).  A <strong>project<\/strong> is a container that holds all of your source code files, images, data files, etc&#8230; that are needed to produce an executable (or library, website, etc&#8230;) that you can run or use.  The project also saves various IDE, compiler, and linker settings, as well as remembering where you left off, so that when you reopen the project later, the state of the IDE can be restored to wherever you left off.  When you choose to compile your program, all of the .cpp files in the project will get compiled and linked.<\/p>\n<p>Each project corresponds to one program.  When you&#8217;re ready to create a second program, you&#8217;ll either need to create a new project, or overwrite the code in an existing project (if you don&#8217;t want to keep it).  Project files are generally IDE specific, so a project created for one IDE will need to be recreated in a different IDE.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightgreenbackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Best practice<\/p>\n<p>Create a new project for each new program you write.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Console projects<\/p>\n<p>When you create a new project, you&#8217;ll generally be asked what type of project you want to create.  All of the projects that we will create in this tutorial will be console projects.  A <strong>console project<\/strong> means that we are going to create programs that can be run from the Windows, Linux, or Mac console.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of the Windows console:<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/images\/CppTutorial\/Chapter0\/WindowsCommandLine-min.png\" alt=\"Windows console\" \/><\/div>\n<p>By default, console applications have no graphical user interface (GUI), they print text to the console, read input from the keyboard, and are compiled into stand-alone executable files.  This is perfect for learning C++, because it keeps the complexity to a minimum, and ensures things work on a wide variety of systems.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;ve never used a console before, or don&#8217;t know how to access it.  We&#8217;ll compile and launch our programs through our IDEs (which will invoke the console when necessary).<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Workspaces \/ solutions<\/p>\n<p>When you create a new project for your program, many IDEs will automatically add your project to a &#8220;workspace&#8221; or a &#8220;solution&#8221; (the term varies by IDE).  A workspace or solution is a container that can hold one or more related projects.  For example, if you were writing a game and wanted to have a separate executable for single player and multiplayer, you&#8217;d need to create two projects.  It wouldn&#8217;t make sense for both of these projects to be completely independent -- after all, they are part of the same game.  Most likely, each would be configured as a separate project within a single workspace\/solution.<\/p>\n<p>Although you can add multiple projects to a single solution, we generally recommend creating a new workspace or solution for each program, especially while learning.  It&#8217;s simpler and there&#8217;s less chance of something going wrong.<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Writing your first program<\/p>\n<p>Traditionally, the first program programmers write in a new language is the infamous <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hello_world\">hello world program<\/a>, and we aren&#8217;t going to deprive you of that experience!

We can probably fix it. :)<\/p>\n<p>First, look at the error message that the compiler gave you.  Most often, it will contain a line number indicating which line was in error.  Examine both that line and the lines around it, and make sure there are no typos or misspellings.  Also make sure you&#8217;re not including line numbers in your code (your editor should be providing those).<\/p>\n<p>Second, look at the Q&#038;A in lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/a-few-common-cpp-problems\/\">0.8 -- A few common C++ problems<\/a>, as your issue may be covered there.<\/p>\n<p>Third, read the comments below the lesson containing the example you&#8217;re compiling -- someone may have encountered the same issue and provided a solution.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, if all of the above fail, try searching for your error message on your favorite search engine.  It&#8217;s likely someone else has encountered this issue before and figured out how to fix it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">If your program runs but the console window flashes and closes immediately<\/p>\n<p>When a console program is run, the console window will open and any output from the program will be written into the console window.<\/p>\n<p>When the program has finished running, most modern IDEs will keep the console open (until you press a key) so you can inspect the results of the program before continuing.  However, some older IDEs will automatically close the console window when the program finishes running.  This is generally not what you want.<\/p>\n<p>If your IDE closes the console window automatically, the following two steps can be used to ensure the console pauses at end of the program.<\/p>\n<p>First, add or ensure the following lines are near the top of your program:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;limits&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Second, add the following code at the end of the main() function (just before the return statement):<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">std::cin.clear(); \/\/ reset any error flags\r\nstd::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits&lt;std::streamsize&gt;::max(), '\\n'); \/\/ ignore any characters in the input buffer until we find a newline\r\nstd::cin.get(); \/\/ get one more char from the user (waits for user to press enter)<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This will cause your program to wait for the user to press enter before continuing (you may have to press enter twice), which will give you time to examine your program&#8217;s output before your IDE closes the console window.<\/p>\n<p>Other solutions, such as the commonly suggested <code>system(\"pause\")<\/code> solution may only work on certain operating systems and should be avoided.<\/p>\n<p>If the console window doesn&#8217;t open at all and your program doesn&#8217;t appear to be running, your anti-virus or anti-malware may also be blocking execution of the program.  If that&#8217;s the case, try temporarily disabling your scanners and see if the problem resolves, or exclude the project directory from your scans.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Tip<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using anti-virus or anti-malware, consider excluding your project directory from the scans, as compiling and debugging may cause false positives.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">What is the difference between the compile, build, rebuild, clean, and run\/start options in my IDE?<\/p>\n<p>In lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/introduction-to-the-compiler-linker-and-libraries\/\">0.5 -- Introduction to the compiler, linker, and libraries<\/a>, we showed that to produce an executable that can be run, each code file in a program is compiled into an object file, and then the object files are linked into an executable.<\/p>\n<p>When a code file is compiled, your IDE may cache (save) the resulting object file on disk.  A <strong>cache<\/strong> (pronounced like &#8220;cash&#8221;) is storage location where frequently accessed data is stored for fast retrieval later.  That way, if the program is compiled again in the future, any code file that hasn&#8217;t been modified doesn&#8217;t need to be recompiled -- the cached object file from last time can be reused (rather than having to be regenerated).  This can speed up compilation times significantly (at the cost of a little bit of disk space).<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, here&#8217;s what each of the options typically does:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Build<\/strong> compiles all <em>modified<\/em> code files in the project or workspace\/solution, and then links the object files into an executable.  If no code files have been modified since the last build, this option does nothing.\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Clean<\/strong> removes all cached objects and executables so the next time the project is built, all files will be recompiled and a new executable produced.\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Rebuild<\/strong> does a &#8220;clean&#8221;, followed by a &#8220;build&#8221;.\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Compile<\/strong> recompiles a single code file (regardless of whether it has been cached previously).  This option does not invoke the linker or produce an executable.\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Run\/start<\/strong> executes the executable from a prior build.  Some IDEs (e.g. Visual Studio) will invoke a &#8220;build&#8221; before doing a &#8220;run&#8221; to ensure you are running the latest version of your code.  Otherwise (e.g. Code::Blocks) will just execute the prior executable.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Although we talk informally about &#8220;compiling&#8221; our programs, to actually compile our programs we will typically choose the &#8220;build&#8221; (or &#8220;run&#8221;) option in our IDE to do so.<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Conclusion<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations, you made it through the hardest part of this tutorial (installing the IDE and compiling your first program)!<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t understand what the different lines in the Hello World program do.
