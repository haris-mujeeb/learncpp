We&#8217;ll use the functionality in this library to get input from the keyboard and output data to the console.  The <em>io<\/em> part of <em>iostream<\/em> stands for <em>input\/output<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>To use the functionality defined within the <em>iostream<\/em> library, we need to include the <em>iostream<\/em> header at the top of any code file that uses the content defined in <em>iostream<\/em>, like so:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\n\/\/ rest of code that uses iostream functionality here<\/code><\/pre>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">std::cout<\/p>\n<p>The <em>iostream<\/em> library contains a few predefined variables for us to use.  One of the most useful is <strong>std::cout<\/strong>, which allows us to send data to the console to be printed as text.  <em>cout<\/em> stands for &#8220;character output&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>As a reminder, here&#8217;s our <em>Hello world<\/em> program:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include &lt;iostream&gt; \/\/ for std::cout\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Hello world!\"; \/\/ print Hello world! to console\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>In this program, we have included <em>iostream<\/em> so that we have access to <em>std::cout<\/em>.  Inside our <em>main<\/em> function, we use <em>std::cout<\/em>, along with the <strong>insertion operator (<code>&lt;&lt;<\/code>)<\/strong>, to send the text <em>Hello world!<\/em> to the console to be printed.<\/p>\n<p><em>std::cout<\/em> can not only print text, it can also print numbers:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include &lt;iostream&gt; \/\/ for std::cout\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; 4; \/\/ print 4 to console\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This produces the result:<\/p>\n<pre>\r\n4\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>It can also be used to print the value of variables:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include &lt;iostream&gt; \/\/ for std::cout\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    int x{ 5 }; \/\/ define integer variable x, initialized with value 5\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; x; \/\/ print value of x (5) to console\r\n    return 0;\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This produces the result:<\/p>\n<pre>\r\n5\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>To print more than one thing on the same line, the insertion operator (<code>&lt;&lt;<\/code>) can be used multiple times in a single statement to concatenate (link together) multiple pieces of output.  For example:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include &lt;iostream&gt; \/\/ for std::cout\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Hello\" &lt;&lt; \" world!\";\r\n    return 0;\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This uses the <code>&lt;&lt;<\/code> operator twice, first to output <code>Hello<\/code> and then to output <code> world<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, this program prints:<\/p>\n<pre>\r\nHello world!\r\n<\/pre>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Tip<\/p>\n<p>It might be helpful to imagine the <code>&lt;&lt;<\/code> operator (and <code>&gt;&gt;<\/code> operator) as a conveyor belt that moves data in the direction indicated.

We can do that by outputting a newline.  A <strong>newline<\/strong> is an OS-specific character or sequence of characters that moves the cursor to the start of the next line.<\/p>\n<p>One way to output a newline is to output <code>std::endl<\/code> (which stands for &#8220;end line&#8221;):  <\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include &lt;iostream&gt; \/\/ for std::cout and std::endl\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Hi!\" &lt;&lt; std::endl; \/\/ std::endl will cause the cursor to move to the next line\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"My name is Alex.\" &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This prints:<\/p>\n<pre>\nHi!\r\nMy name is Alex.\r\n<\/pre>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Tip<\/p>\n<p>In the above program, the second <code>std::endl<\/code> isn&#8217;t technically necessary, since the program ends immediately afterward.  However, it serves a few useful purposes.<\/p>\n<p>First, it helps indicate that the line of output is a &#8220;complete thought&#8221; (as opposed to partial output that is completed somewhere later in the code).  In this sense, it functions similarly to using a period in standard English.<\/p>\n<p>Second, it positions the cursor on the next line, so that if we later add additional lines of output (e.g. have the program say &#8220;bye!&#8221;), those lines will appear where we expect (rather than appended to the prior line of output).<\/p>\n<p>Third, after running an executable from the command line, some operating systems do not output a new line before showing the command prompt again.  If our program does not end with the cursor on a new line, the command prompt may appear appended to the prior line of output, rather than at the start of a new line as the user would expect.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightgreenbackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Best practice<\/p>\n<p>Output a newline whenever a line of output is complete.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\"><code>std::cout<\/code> is buffered<\/p>\n<p>Consider a rollercoaster ride at your favorite amusement park.  Passengers show up (at some variable rate) and get in line.  Periodically, a train arrives and boards passengers (up to the maximum capacity of the train).  When the train is full, or when enough time has passed, the train departs with a batch of passengers, and the ride commences.  Any passengers unable to board the current train wait for the next one.<\/p>\n<p>This analogy is similar to how output sent to <code>std::cout<\/code> is typically processed in C++.  Statements in our program request that output be sent to the console.  However, that output is typically not sent to the console immediately.  Instead, the requested output &#8220;gets in line&#8221;, and is stored in a region of memory set aside to collect such requests (called a <strong>buffer<\/strong>).  Periodically, the buffer is <strong>flushed<\/strong>, meaning all of the data collected in the buffer is transferred to its destination (in this case, the console).<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Author&#8217;s note<\/p>\n<p>To use another analogy, flushing a buffer is kind of like flushing a toilet.  All of your collected &#8220;output&#8221; is transferred to &#8230; wherever it goes next.  Eew.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p>This also means that if your program crashes, aborts, or is paused (e.g. for debugging purposes) before the buffer is flushed, any output still waiting in the buffer will not be displayed.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Key insight<\/p>\n<p>The opposite of buffered output is unbuffered output.  With unbuffered output, each individual output request is sent directly to the output device.<\/p>\n<p>Writing data to a buffer is typically fast, whereas transferring a batch of data to an output device is comparatively slow.  Buffering can significantly increase performance by batching multiple output requests together to minimize the number of times output has to be sent to the output device.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\"><code>std::endl<\/code> vs <code>\\n<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Using <code>std::endl<\/code> is often inefficient, as it actually does two jobs: it outputs a newline (moving the cursor to the next line of the console), and it flushes the buffer (which is slow).  If we output multiple lines of text ending with <code>std::endl<\/code>, we will get multiple flushes, which is slow and probably unnecessary.<\/p>\n<p>When outputting text to the console, we typically don&#8217;t need to explicitly flush the buffer ourselves.  C++&#8217;s output system is designed to self-flush periodically, and it&#8217;s both simpler and more efficient to let it flush itself.<\/p>\n<p>To output a newline without flushing the output buffer, we use <code>\\n<\/code> (inside either single or double quotes), which is a special symbol that the compiler interprets as a newline character.  <code>\\n<\/code> moves the cursor to the next line of the console without causing a flush, so it will typically perform better.  <code>\\n<\/code> is also more concise to type and can be embedded into existing double-quoted text.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example that uses <code>\\n<\/code> in a few different ways:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include &lt;iostream&gt; \/\/ for std::cout\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    int x{ 5 };\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"x is equal to: \" &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; '\\n'; \/\/ single quoted (by itself) (conventional)\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Yep.\" &lt;&lt; \"\\n\";                 \/\/ double quoted (by itself) (unconventional but okay)\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"And that's all, folks!\\n\";     \/\/ between double quotes in existing text (conventional)\r\n    return 0;\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This prints:<\/p>\n<pre>\nx is equal to: 5\r\nYep.\r\nAnd that's all, folks!\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>When <code>\\n<\/code> is not being embedded into an existing line of double-quoted text (e.g. <code>\"hello\\n\")<\/code>, it is conventionally single quoted (<code>'\\n'<\/code>).<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">For advanced readers<\/p>\n<p>In C++, we use single quotes to represent single characters (such as <code>'a'<\/code> or <code>'$'<\/code>), and double-quotes to represent text (zero or more characters).<\/p>\n<p>Even though &#8216;\\n&#8217; is represented in source code as two symbols, it is treated by the compiler as a single linefeed (LF) character (with ASCII value 10), and thus is conventionally single quoted (unless embedded into existing double-quoted text).  We discuss this more in lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/chars\/\">4.11 -- Chars<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When &#8216;\\n&#8217; is output, the library doing the outputting is responsible for translating this single LF character into the appropriate newline sequence for the given OS.

Whereas <code>std::cout<\/code> prints data to the console (using the insertion operator <code>&lt;&lt;<\/code> to provide the data), <code>std::cin<\/code> (which stands for &#8220;character input&#8221;) reads input from keyboard.

Because <code>b<\/code> is not a valid integer, no characters can be extracted, so this is an extraction failure.  Variable <code>x<\/code> would be set to <code>0<\/code>, and future extractions will fail until the input stream is cleared.\n<\/li>\n<li>If <code>std::cin<\/code> is not in a good state due to a prior failed extraction, nothing happens here.
