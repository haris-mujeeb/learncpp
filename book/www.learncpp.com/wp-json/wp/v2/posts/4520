There are two types of object composition: composition, and aggregation.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Composition<\/strong> exists when a member of a class has a part-of relationship with the class.  In a composition relationship, the class manages the existence of the members.  To qualify as a <strong>composition<\/strong>, an object and a part must have the following relationship:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The part (member) is part of the object (class)<\/li>\n<li>The part (member) can only belong to one object (class) at a time<\/li>\n<li>The part (member) has its existence managed by the object (class)<\/li>\n<li>The part (member) does not know about the existence of the object (class)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Compositions are typically implemented via normal member variables, or by pointers where the class manages all the memory allocation and deallocation.  If you can implement a class as a composition, you should implement a class as a composition.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Aggregations<\/strong> exists when a class has a has-a relationship with the member.  In an aggregation relationship, the class does not manage the existence of the members.  To qualify as an <strong>aggregation<\/strong>, an object and its parts must have the following relationship:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The part (member) is part of the object (class)<\/li>\n<li>The part (member) can belong to more than one object (class) at a time<\/li>\n<li>The part (member) does <em>not<\/em> have its existence managed by the object (class)<\/li>\n<li>The part (member) does not know about the existence of the object (class)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Aggregations are typically implemented via pointer or reference.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Associations<\/strong> are a looser type of relationship, where the class uses-an otherwise unrelated object.  To qualify as an <strong>association<\/strong>, an object and an associated object must have the following relationship:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The associated object (member) is otherwise unrelated to the object (class)<\/li>\n<li>The associated object (member) can belong to more than one object (class) at a time<\/li>\n<li>The associated object (member) does <em>not<\/em> have its existence managed by the object (class)<\/li>\n<li>The associated object (member) may or may not know about the existence of the object (class)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Associations may be implemented via pointer or reference, or by a more indirect means (such as holding the index or key of the associated object).<\/p>\n<p>In a <strong>dependency<\/strong>, one class uses another class to perform a task.  The dependent class typically is not a member of the class using it, but rather is temporarily created, used, and then destroyed, or passed into a member function from an external source.<\/p>\n<p>In a <strong>container class<\/strong> one class provides a container to hold multiple objects of another type.  A <strong>value container<\/strong> is a composition that stores copies of the objects it is holding.  A <strong>reference container<\/strong> is an aggregation that stores pointers or references to objects that live outside the container.<\/p>\n<p>std::initializer_list can be used to implement constructors, assignment operators, and other functions that accept a list initialization parameter.  std::initializer_list lives in the &lt;initializer_list&gt; header.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-table-wrapper\"><table class=\"cpp-table\"><\/p>\n<tr>\n<th>Property\\Type<\/th>\n<th>Composition<\/th>\n<th>Aggregation<\/th>\n<th>Association<\/th>\n<th>Dependency<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Relationship type<\/td>\n<td>Whole\/part<\/td>\n<td>Whole\/part<\/td>\n<td>Otherwise unrelated<\/td>\n<td>Otherwise unrelated<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Members can belong to multiple classes<\/td>\n<td>No<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Members existence managed by class<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<td>No<\/td>\n<td>No<\/td>\n<td>No<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Directionality<\/td>\n<td>Unidirectional<\/td>\n<td>Unidirectional<\/td>\n<td>Unidirectional or bidirectional<\/td>\n<td>Unidirectional<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Relationship verb<\/td>\n<td>Part-of<\/td>\n<td>Has-a<\/td>\n<td>Uses-a<\/td>\n<td>Depends-on<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<p><\/table><\/div>\n<p><strong>Quiz time<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This chapter is pretty straightforward and a little more abstract than the previous ones, so this quiz will be short and to the point.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li>What type of relationship (composition, aggregation, association, or dependency) do the following describe?\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>1a) An Animal class that contains an animal type (enum) and name (string).<br \/>\n<a class=\"solution_link_show\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"cppSolutionToggle(document.getElementById('cpp_solution_id_0'), this, 'Show Solution', 'Hide Solution')\">Show Solution<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"wpsolution\" id=\"cpp_solution_id_0\" style=\"display:none\">\nComposition -- The animal type and name don&#8217;t have a use outside of the Animal.<\/div>\n<p>1b) A text editor class with a save() function that takes a File object as an argument.
