Under the as-if rule, the compiler may choose whether to evaluate certain expressions at runtime or compile-time:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">const double x { 1.2 };\r\nconst double y { 3.4 };\r\nconst double z { x + y }; \/\/ x + y may evaluate at runtime or compile-time<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The expression <code>x + y<\/code> would normally evaluate at runtime, but since the value of <code>x<\/code> and <code>y<\/code> are known at compile-time, the compiler may opt to perform compile-time evaluation instead and initialize <code>z<\/code> with the compile-time calculated value <code>4.6<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>In a few other cases, the C++ language requires an expression that can be evaluated at compile-time.  For example, constexpr variables require an initializer that can be evaluated at compile-time:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">int main()\r\n{\r\n    constexpr int x { expr }; \/\/ Because variable x is constexpr, expr must be evaluatable at compile-time\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>In cases where a constant expression is required but one is not provided, the compiler will error and halt compilation.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll discuss constexpr variables in the next lesson (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/constexpr-variables\/\">5.6 -- Constexpr variables<\/a>), when we cover constexpr variables.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">For advanced readers<\/p>\n<p>A few common cases where a compile-time evaluatable expression is required:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The initializer of a constexpr variable (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/constexpr-variables\/\">5.6 -- Constexpr variables<\/a>).\n<\/li>\n<li>A non-type template argument (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/non-type-template-parameters\/\">11.9 -- Non-type template parameters<\/a>).\n<\/li>\n<li>The defined length of a <code>std::array<\/code> (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/introduction-to-stdarray\/\">17.1 -- Introduction to std::array<\/a>) or a C-style array (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/introduction-to-c-style-arrays\/\">17.7 -- Introduction to C-style arrays<\/a>).\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<p>In this lesson, we&#8217;ll explore more of C++&#8217;s capabilities around compile-time evaluation, and look at how C++ differentiates this last case from the prior two cases.<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\"><a name=\"compiletimebenefits\"><\/a>The benefits of compile-time programming <a href=\"#compiletimebenefits\"><i class=\"fa fa-link\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\"><\/i><\/a><\/p>\n<p>While the as-if rule is great for improving performance, it leaves us reliant on the sophistication of the compiler to actually determine what can evaluate at compile-time.  This means if there is a section of code we really want to execute at compile-time, it may or may not.  That same code compiled on a different platform, or with a different compiler, or using different compilation options, or slightly modified, may produce a different result.  Because the as-if rule is applied invisibly to us, we get no feedback from the compiler on what portions of code it decided to evaluate at compile-time, or why.  Code we desire to be evaluated at compile-time may not even be eligible (due to a typo or misunderstanding), and we may never know.<\/p>\n<p>To improve upon this situation, the C++ language provides ways for us to be explicit about what parts of code we want to execute at compile-time.  The use of language features that result in compile-time evaluation is called <strong>compile-time programming<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>These features can help improve software in a number of areas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Performance: Compile-time evaluation makes our programs smaller and faster.  The more code we can ensure is capable of evaluating at compile-time, the more performance benefit we&#8217;ll see.\n<\/li>\n<li>Versatility: We can always use such code in places that require a compile-time value.  Code that relies on the as-if rule to evaluate at compile-time can&#8217;t be used in such places (even if the compiler opts to evaluate that code at compile-time) -- this decision was made so that code that compiles today won&#8217;t stop compiling tomorrow, when the compiler decides to optimize differently.\n<\/li>\n<li>Predictability: We can have the compiler halt compilation if it determines that code cannot be executed at compile-time (rather than silently opting to have that code evaluate at runtime instead).  This allows us to ensure a section of code we really want to execute at compile-time will.\n<\/li>\n<li>Quality: We can have the compiler reliably detect certain kinds of programming errors at compile-time, and halt the build if it encounters them.  This is much more effective than trying to detect and gracefully handle those same errors at runtime.\n<\/li>\n<li>Quality: Perhaps most importantly, undefined behavior is not allowed at compile-time.  If we do something that causes undefined behavior at compile-time, the compiler should halt the build and ask us to fix it.  Note that this is a hard problem for compilers, and they may not catch all cases.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To summarize, compile-time evaluation allows us to write programs that are both more performant and of higher quality (more secure and less buggy)!  So while compile-time evaluation does add some additional complexity to the language, the benefits can be substantial.<\/p>\n<p>The following C++ features are the most foundational to compile-time programming:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Constexpr variables (discussed in upcoming lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/constexpr-variables\/\">5.6 -- Constexpr variables<\/a>).\n<\/li>\n<li>Constexpr functions (discussed in upcoming lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/constexpr-functions\/\">F.1 -- Constexpr functions<\/a>).\n<\/li>\n<li>Templates (introduced in lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/function-templates\/\">11.6 -- Function templates<\/a>).\n<\/li>\n<li>static_assert (discussed in lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/assert-and-static_assert\/\">9.6 -- Assert and static_assert<\/a>).\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All of these features have one thing in common: they make use of constant expressions.<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\"><a name=\"constantexpressions\"><\/a>Constant expressions <a href=\"#constantexpressions\"><i class=\"fa fa-link\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\"><\/i><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the C++ standard barely mentions &#8220;compile-time&#8221; at all.  Instead, the standard defines a &#8220;constant expression&#8221;, which is an expression that must be evaluatable at compile-time, along with rules that determine how the compiler should handle these expressions.  Constant expressions form the backbone of compile-time evaluation in C++.<\/p>\n<p>In lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/introduction-to-expressions\/\">1.10 -- Introduction to expressions<\/a>, we defined an expression as &#8220;a non-empty sequence of literals, variables, operators, and function calls&#8221;.  A <strong>constant expression<\/strong> is a non-empty sequence of literals, constant variables, operators, and function calls, all of which must be evaluatable at compile-time.  The key difference is that in a constant expression, each part of the expression must be evaluatable at compile-time.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Key insight<\/p>\n<p>In a constant expression, each part of the expression must be evaluatable at compile-time.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p>An expression that is not a constant expression is often called a non-constant expression, and may informally be called a <strong>runtime expression<\/strong> (as such expressions typically evaluate at runtime).<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Optional reading<\/p>\n<p>The C++20 language standard (in section &#091;expr.const&#093;) states &#8220;Constant expressions can be evaluated during translation&#8221;.  As we covered in lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/introduction-to-the-preprocessor\/\">2.10 -- Introduction to the preprocessor<\/a>, translation is the whole process of building a program (that includes preprocessing, compiling, and linking).  Therefore, in a compiled program, constant expressions can be evaluated as part of the compilation process.  In an interpreted program, translation happens at runtime.<\/p>\n<p>Since C++ programs are typically compiled, we&#8217;ll proceed under the assumption that constant expressions can be evaluated at compile-time.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">What can be in a constant expression?<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Author&#8217;s note<\/p>\n<p>In technical terms, constant expressions are quite complex.  In this section, we&#8217;ll go into a little bit deeper into what they can and can&#8217;t contain.  You do not need to remember most of this.

If our code has a buggy calculation that is evaluated at compile-time, we have limited tools to diagnose the issue.  Allowing non-required constant expressions to be evaluated at runtime (typically when optimizations are turned off) enables runtime debugging of our code.  Being able to step through and inspect the state of our programs while they are running can make finding bugs easier.\n<\/li>\n<li>To provide the compiler with the flexibility to optimize as it sees fit (or as influenced by compiler options).

The value of <code>x<\/code> is known to the compiler at this point.  But then <code>x<\/code> is assigned a value from the user.  The compiler can&#8217;t know what value the user will provide at compile-time, so beyond this point, the value of <code>x<\/code> is not known to the compiler.  Thus, the expression <code>x<\/code> is not always evaluatable at compile-time, violating the requirement that such an expression must always be capable of being evaluated at compile-time.<\/p>\n<p>Because constants cannot have their values changed, a constant variable whose initializer is evaluatable at compile-time will always have a value that is known at compile-time.  This keeps things simple.<\/p>\n<p>While the language designers could have defined a compile-time expression as one whose values are all currently known at compile-time (rather than an expression that must always be capable of being evaluated at compile-time), this would have added significant complexity to the compiler (as the compiler would now be responsible for determining when every variable could be changed to a value not known at compile-time).  Adding a single line of code (such as <code>std::cin &gt;&gt; x<\/code>) could break the program elsewhere (if <code>x<\/code> was being used in any context that required a value known at compile-time).<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Quiz time<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-quiz-question\" style=\"clear: both\">Question #1<\/p>\n<p>For each statement, identify:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whether the initializer is a constant expression or non-constant expression.\n<\/li>\n<li>Whether the variable is a constant expression or non-constant expression.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>a)<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">    char a { 'q' };<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><a class=\"solution_link_show\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"cppSolutionToggle(document.getElementById('cpp_solution_id_0'), this, 'Show Solution', 'Hide Solution')\">Show Solution<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"wpsolution\" id=\"cpp_solution_id_0\" style=\"display:none\">\n<p><code>'q'<\/code> is a constant expression because it is a literal.<br \/>\n<code>a<\/code> is a non-constant expression because it is defined as non-const.\n<\/div>\n<p>b)<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">    const int b { 0 };<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><a class=\"solution_link_show\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"cppSolutionToggle(document.getElementById('cpp_solution_id_1'), this, 'Show Solution', 'Hide Solution')\">Show Solution<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"wpsolution\" id=\"cpp_solution_id_1\" style=\"display:none\">\n<p><code>0<\/code> is a constant expression since it is a literal.<br \/>\n<code>b<\/code> is a constant expression since it is a <code>const<\/code> integral type with a constant expression initializer.\n<\/div>\n<p>c)<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">    const double c { 5.0 };<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><a class=\"solution_link_show\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"cppSolutionToggle(document.getElementById('cpp_solution_id_2'), this, 'Show Solution', 'Hide Solution')\">Show Solution<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"wpsolution\" id=\"cpp_solution_id_2\" style=\"display:none\">\n<p><code>'5.0'<\/code> is a constant expression because it is a literal.<br \/>\n<code>c<\/code> is a non-constant expression because it is defined as <code>const<\/code> but does not have an integral type.<\/p>\n<p>Per the definition of a compile-time constant, only const <em>integral<\/em> variables with a constant expression initializer are compile-time constants.  <code>c<\/code> is a double, which is not an integral type, so it does not meet this definition.\n<\/div>\n<p>d)<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">    const int d { a * 2 };
