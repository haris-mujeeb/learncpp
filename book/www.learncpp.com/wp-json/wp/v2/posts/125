Real-life objects have two major components to them: 1) Some number of observable properties (e.g. weight, color, size, solidity, shape, etc\u2026), and 2) Some number of actions that they can perform or have performed on them (e.g. being opened, damaging something else, etc\u2026) based on those properties. These properties and actions are inseparable.<\/p>\n<p>In programming, we represent properties with variables, and actions with functions.<\/p>\n<p>In the <code>Date<\/code> example above, note that we have defined our properties (the member variables of <code>Date<\/code>) and the actions we perform using those properties (the function <code>print()<\/code>) separately.  We are left to infer a connection between <code>Date<\/code> and <code>print()<\/code> based solely on the <code>const Date&amp;<\/code> parameter of <code>print()<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>While we could put both <code>Date<\/code> and <code>print()<\/code> into a namespace (to make it clearer that the two are meant to be packaged together), that adds yet more names into our program and more namespace prefixes, cluttering our code.<\/p>\n<p>It sure would be nice if there were some way to define our properties and actions together, as a single package.<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Member functions<\/p>\n<p>In addition to having member variables, class types (which includes structs, classes, and unions) can also have their own functions!

By default, it has external linkage, so it could be called from other source files (with the appropriate forward declaration).<\/p>\n<p>In the member example, the <code>print()<\/code> member function is declared (and in this case, defined) inside the <code>Date<\/code> struct definition.  Because <code>print()<\/code> is declared as part of the <code>Date<\/code>, this tells the compiler that <code>print()<\/code> is a member function.<\/p>\n<p>Member functions defined inside the class type definition are implicitly inline, so they will not cause violations of the one-definition rule if the class type definition is included into multiple code files.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Related content<\/p>\n<p>Member functions can also be (forward) declared inside the class definition, and defined after the class definition.

This syntax, which uses the member selection operator (.) to select the member function to call, is consistent with how we access member variables (e.g. <code>today.day = 16;<\/code>).<\/p>\n<p>All (non-static) member functions must be called using an object of that class type. In this case, <code>today<\/code> is the object that <code>print()<\/code> is being called on.<\/p>\n<p>Note that in the member function case, we don&#8217;t need to pass <code>today<\/code> as an argument.  The object that a member function is called on is <em>implicitly<\/em> passed to the member function.  For this reason, the object that a member function is called on is often called <strong>the implicit object<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, when we call <code>today.print()<\/code>, <code>today<\/code> is the implicit object, and it is implicitly passed to the <code>print()<\/code> member function.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Related content<\/p>\n<p>We cover the mechanics of how the associated object is actually passed to a member function in lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/the-hidden-this-pointer-and-member-function-chaining\/\">15.1 -- The hidden &#8220;this&#8221; pointer and member function chaining<\/a>.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Accessing members inside a member function uses the implicit object<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the non-member version of <code>print()<\/code> again:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">\/\/ non-member version of print\r\nvoid print(const Date&amp; date)\r\n{\r\n    \/\/ member variables accessed using member selection operator (.)\r\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; date.year &lt;&lt; '\/' &lt;&lt; date.month &lt;&lt; '\/' &lt;&lt; date.day;\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This version of <code>print()<\/code> has reference parameter <code>const Date&amp; date<\/code>.

When <code>print(today)<\/code> is called, the <code>date<\/code> reference parameter is bound to argument <code>today<\/code>, and <code>date.year<\/code>, <code>date.month<\/code>, and <code>date.day<\/code> evaluate to <code>today.year<\/code>, <code>today.month<\/code>, and <code>today.day<\/code> respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s look at the definition of the <code>print()<\/code> member function again:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">    void print() \/\/ defines a member function named print()\r\n    {\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; year &lt;&lt; '\/' &lt;&lt; month &lt;&lt; '\/' &lt;&lt; day;\r\n    }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>In the member example, we access the members as <code>year<\/code>, <code>month,<\/code> and <code>day<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>Inside a member function, any member identifier that is not prefixed with the member selection operator (.) is associated with the implicit object.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, when <code>today.print()<\/code> is called, <code>today<\/code> is our implicit object, and <code>year<\/code>, <code>month<\/code>, and <code>day<\/code> (which are not prefixed) evaluate to the values of <code>today.year<\/code>, <code>today.month<\/code>, and <code>today.day<\/code> respectively.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Key insight<\/p>\n<p>With non-member functions, we have to explicitly pass an object to the function to work with, and members are explicitly accessed through that object.<\/p>\n<p>With member functions, we implicitly pass an object to the function to work with, and members are implicitly accessed through that object.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Another member function example<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example with a slightly more complex member function:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;string&gt;\r\n\r\nstruct Person\r\n{\r\n    std::string name{};\r\n    int age{};\r\n\r\n    void kisses(const Person&amp; person)\r\n    {\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; \" kisses \" &lt;&lt; person.name &lt;&lt; '\\n';\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    Person joe{ \"Joe\", 29 };\r\n    Person kate{ \"Kate\", 27 };\r\n\r\n    joe.kisses(kate);\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This produces the output:<\/p>\n<pre>\nJoe kisses Kate\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Let&#8217;s examine how this works.  First, we define two <code>Person<\/code> structs, <code>joe<\/code> and <code>kate<\/code>.  Next, we call <code>joe.kisses(kate)<\/code>.  <code>joe<\/code> is the implicit object here, and <code>kate<\/code> is passed as an explicit argument.<\/p>\n<p>When the <code>kisses()<\/code> member function executes, the identifier <code>name<\/code> doesn&#8217;t use the member selection operator (.), so it refers to the implicit object, which is <code>joe<\/code>.  So this resolves to <code>joe.name<\/code>.  <code>person.name<\/code> uses the member selection operator, so it does not refer to the implicit object.  Since <code>person<\/code> is a reference for <code>kate<\/code>, this resolves to <code>kate.name<\/code>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Key insight<\/p>\n<p>Without a member function, we would have written <code>kisses(joe, kate)<\/code>.  With a member function, we write <code>joe.kisses(kate)<\/code>.  Note how much better the latter reads, and how it makes clear exactly which object is initiating the action and which is in support.\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Member variables and functions can be defined in any order<\/p>\n<p>The C++ compiler normally compiles code from top to bottom.

This means you can define member variables and member functions in any order you like!<\/p>\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-cpp line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-cpp match-braces\">struct Foo\r\n{\r\n    int z() { return m_data; } \/\/ We can access data members before they are defined\r\n    int x() { return y(); }    \/\/ We can access member functions before they are defined\r\n\r\n    int m_data { y() };        \/\/ This even works in default member initializers (see warning below)\r\n    int y() { return 5; }\r\n};<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>We discuss a recommended order for member definition in upcoming lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/the-benefits-of-data-hiding-encapsulation\/\">14.8 -- The benefits of data hiding (encapsulation)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightredbackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Warning<\/p>\n<p>Data members are initialized in order of declaration.

Bjarne was concerned that giving structs access to a limited subset of capabilities would end up adding complexity and edge-cases to the language.  For simplicity, he ultimately decided that structs and classes would have a unified ruleset (meaning structs can do everything classes can, and vice-versa), and convention could dictate how structs would actually be used.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p>In modern C++, it is fine for structs to have member functions.  This excludes constructors, which are a special type of member function that we cover in upcoming lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/introduction-to-constructors\/\">14.9 -- Introduction to constructors<\/a>.
