This is typically done to ensure the compiler makers have had a chance to resolve defects, and so that best practices for new features are well understood.  Where relevant, this also helps ensure better cross-platform compatibility, as compilers on some platforms may not provide full support for newer language standards immediately.<\/p>\n<p>For personal projects and while learning, we recommend choosing the latest finalized standard, as there is little downside to doing so.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Tip<\/p>\n<p>Many compilers offer &#8220;experimental&#8221; or &#8220;preview&#8221; support for features from the upcoming non-finalized language standards.  Your IDE may offer this as an option in the settings where you configure your language standard, or you may be able to enable it manually using the upcoming language standard&#8217;s conventional name or development name.<\/p>\n<p>Support for features from non-finalized language standards will be incomplete and possibly buggy.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">Author&#8217;s note<\/p>\n<p>This website currently targets the C++17 standard, meaning our lessons and examples assume your compiler is C++17 capable.  Some C++20 and C++23 content is available for those with compatible compilers.<\/p>\n<p>To take full advantage of all the lesson content, we recommend using the latest language standard your compiler supports.<\/p>\n<p>If your compiler doesn&#8217;t support C++17, we recommend upgrading to one that does, or consider using an online compiler that supports C++17 or newer while learning.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">A reminder<\/p>\n<p>When changing your language standard (or any other project setting), make the change to all build configurations.\n<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Setting a language standard in Visual Studio<\/p>\n<p>As of the time of writing, Visual Studio 2022 defaults to C++14 capabilities, which does not allow for the use of newer features introduced in C++17 and C++20.<\/p>\n<p>To use these newer features, you&#8217;ll need to enable a newer language standard.

Fortunately, most IDEs provide a way to export your settings.  This is typically done by creating a new project template with the settings you want, and then selecting that project template when you create a new project.<\/p>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightyellowbackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">For Visual Studio users<\/p>\n<p>In Visual Studio, this option is available via Project -> Export Template.

You can open up your .cpp file in the Solution Explorer window by going to Solution -> &lt;Project Name&gt; -> Source Files -> &lt;template name&gt;.cpp.<\/p>\n<p>Feb 2025: Reader Mingtao Yue kindly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/configuring-your-compiler-choosing-a-language-standard\/#comment-607992\">left a comment<\/a> providing some workarounds to a couple of bugs in this feature.\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cpp-note cpp-lightyellowbackground\">\n<p class=\"cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline\">For Code::Blocks users<\/p>\n<p>In Code::Blocks, choose File -> Save project as template.

The standards document is not designed for learning -- rather, it&#8217;s designed for compiler writers to be able to implement new language standards accurately.  You will occasionally see people quoting the standards document when explaining how something works.<\/p>\n<p>The approved C++ standards document for a given language standard is not available for free.  There is a link to purchase the latest standard <a href=\"https:\/\/isocpp.org\/std\/the-standard\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When a new language standard is being developed, draft standards documents are published for review.  These drafts <em>are<\/em> available online for free.  The last draft standard before the approved standard is generally close enough to the official standard to use for most purposes.  You can find the draft standards <a href=\"https:\/\/www.open-std.org\/jtc1\/sc22\/wg21\/docs\/standards\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"cpp-section cpp-topline\" style=\"clear: both\">Compilers often have incomplete support for new language features<\/p>\n<p>Even after a language standard is finalized, compilers supporting that language standard often still have missing, partial, or buggy support for certain features.<\/p>\n<p>If you attempt to compile a program that should compile but mysteriously won&#8217;t, it&#8217;s likely because of one of two reasons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your compiler is configured to use an older language standard that doesn&#8217;t support the feature you are using.  Try selecting a newer language standard and compile your program again.  You can use the program in lesson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/what-language-standard-is-my-compiler-using\/\">0.13 -- What language standard is my compiler using?<\/a> to validate that you have configured your language standard selection correctly.\n<\/li>\n<li>The version of the compiler you are running may have missing, partial, or buggy support for a feature you are using.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The CPPReference website tracks compiler support for each feature per language standard.  You can find those support tables linked from their <a href=\"https:\/\/en.cppreference.com\/w\/cpp\">home page<\/a>, top right, under &#8220;Compiler Support&#8221; (by language standard).  For example, you can see which C++23 features are supported <a href=\"https:\/\/en.cppreference.com\/w\/cpp\/compiler_support\/23\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If a newer version of your compiler supports the problematic feature, you can upgrade your compiler to the latest version and try compiling your program again.  If the latest version of your compiler still doesn&#8217;t support the feature you are trying to use, you can either try a different compiler that does provide support, or find a solution using a different set of features.<\/p>\n<div class=\"prevnext\"><div class=\"prevnext-inline\">\n\t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/what-language-standard-is-my-compiler-using\/\">\n <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-next\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-chevron-circle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Next lesson<\/div>\n      <div class=\"nav-button-lesson\">\n        <span class=\"nav-button-lesson-number\">0.13<\/span>What language standard is my compiler using?\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div><\/a>\n  \t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"\/\">\n  <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-index\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-home\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Back to table of contents<\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div><\/a>\n  \t<a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.learncpp.com\/cpp-tutorial\/configuring-your-compiler-warning-and-error-levels\/\">\n  <div class=\"nav-button nav-button-prev\">\n    <div class=\"nav-button-icon\"><i class=\"fa fa-chevron-circle-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/i><\/div>\n    <div class=\"nav-button-text\">\n      <div class=\"nav-button-title\">Previous lesson<\/div>\n      <div class=\"nav-button-lesson\">\n        <span class=\"nav-button-lesson-number\">0.11<\/span>Configuring your compiler: Warning and error levels\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div><\/a>\n  <\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With many different versions of C++ available (C++98, C++03, C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, C++23, etc&#8230;) how does your compiler know which one to use?
