# Chapter 12: References and Pointers - Advanced C++ Concepts

This directory will contain the C++ code examples, notes, and tests for advanced concepts related to references and pointers, as outlined in the GEMINI.md guide.

## Learning Path

1.  **Smart Pointers & Resource Management (RAII)**
    *   `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, `std::weak_ptr`, Custom Deleters, RAII principle.
    *   Challenge: Ensuring resource release with exceptions.
    *   Task: Implement a class managing a dynamic array with `std::unique_ptr` and custom deleter. Write `gtest` cases.

*(This README will be updated as we progress through the concepts.)*
